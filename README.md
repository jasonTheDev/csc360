# csc360
These 3 projects were created for my Operating Systems class. They demonstrate the  following competencies:
* multi-process programming
* multi-threaded programming
* working with a file system

There is an accompanying README in each assignment folder that explains more about the given program.

## The 3 Programs
### A1 - A Process Manager (PMan)
This is a process manager that allows you to run, pause, start, kill and print info about processes running in the background. It uses system calls like `fork()` and `execv()` and demonstrates an ability to write multi-process programs.

### A2 - An Airline Check-in Simulator (ACS)
Simulates an airline check-in by representing passengers and clerks with different threads. Uses the pthread library to demonstrate skills needed for multi-thread programming.

### A3 - A FAT12 File Manager
These are 4 separate C programs that manipulate data on FAT12 (IMA) disks.
